# S1.1: Set Up Monorepo Structure

**Sprint**: 1  
**Story Points**: 5  
**Assignee**: Both Developers  
**Priority**: P0 - Critical  
**Dependencies**: None

---

## User Story

As a **developer**, I want a **well-organized monorepo structure** so that **multiple services can be developed in parallel with shared code and consistent tooling**.

---

## Description

Create the foundational monorepo directory structure for the Modern POS system. This includes setting up Go workspaces, creating service directories, and establishing shared proto definitions.

The monorepo will use Go 1.24+ workspaces to allow multiple modules while sharing dependencies efficiently.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Root directory `modern-pos/` created with `go.work` file
- [ ] Service directories created:
  - `services/platform/` with `go.mod`
  - `services/item-management/` with `go.mod`
  - `services/order-fulfillment/` with `go.mod`
  - `services/communication/` with `go.mod`
- [ ] Shared directories created:
  - `proto/` for proto definitions
  - `frontend/` for React application
  - `scripts/` for automation scripts
- [ ] Each service `go.mod` has correct module name
- [ ] `go.work` file includes all service modules
- [ ] `go work sync` runs successfully
- [ ] Directory structure documented in README.md

---

## Definition of Done

- [x] All directories created with correct structure
- [x] Go workspace configured and functional
- [x] README.md documents the structure
- [x] Can run `go work use ./services/*` successfully
- [x] Code committed to git with message: "feat: initialize monorepo structure"

## Technical Details

### Directory Structure
```
modern-pos/
├── go.work
├── README.md
├── Makefile
├── docker-compose.yml
├── proto/
│   └── common/
├── services/
│   ├── platform/
│   │   ├── go.mod
│   │   ├── main.go
│   │   ├── internal/
│   │   └── migrations/
│   ├── item-management/
│   │   ├── go.mod
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── order-fulfillment/
│   │   ├── go.mod
│   │   └── ...
│   └── communication/
│       ├── go.mod
│       └── ...
├── frontend/
│   └── package.json
└── scripts/
    ├── setup.sh
    └── seed.sql
```

### Go Workspace Configuration
```go
// go.work
go 1.24

use (
    ./services/platform
    ./services/item-management
    ./services/order-fulfillment
    ./services/communication
)
```

---

## Implementation Steps

1. Create root directory and initialize Go workspace
2. Create service directories with go.mod files
3. Create shared directories (proto, frontend, scripts)
4. Configure go.work to include all modules
5. Create initial README.md documenting structure
6. Test workspace with `go work sync`

---

## Testing

```bash
# Verify structure
ls -la services/*/go.mod

# Verify workspace
go work sync
go work use ./services/*

# Should show all modules
go list -m all
```

---

## Time Estimate

**Estimated**: 1 hour  
**Actual**: ___ hours

---

## Notes

- Use Go 1.24+ for workspace support
- Each service is independently deployable
- Shared code goes in proto/ directory
- Frontend is separate from backend services
